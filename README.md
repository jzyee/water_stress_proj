# water stress proj

This project will be inspecting the effects of water stress found from remote sensing data.


> 1. Indentifying points of interest using change point detection
> 2. Use Casual Impact to measure the effect of a piont of interest
> 3. Applying the first two point to forcasts to aid preventative measures
